### Information

* **Distro**: Arch Linux
* **WM**: Hyprland
* **LM**: sddm

***These will be heavily based for arch but should work on any distro running these things. no gurantee though. however the install deps will be arch only, simply due to its what i use.***



***Contributions:***
***Open to help when it comes to scripts n stuff, and if config is hardcoding my stuff explicitly (ex /home/malissa and not $HOME or ~), otherwise PRs or issues will be closed.***
