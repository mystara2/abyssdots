# Themeing

* QSS template for wal
* Prism Launcher template for wal/and or Kvantum.
* Figure out how to get Zen Browser to work w/ pywal, *(saw a thing abt it, not sure how to get it to work.)*
* Move starship.toml to ~/.config/wal/templates/starship-wal.toml then symlink to ~/.config/starship.toml when it generates it


# Scripts

* Make editconfig have a keybinds key at the bottom
* Make install deps look nicer && have a normal install.sh for just everything including either stow or sm else.

# Prompts

* readd proper git integration w/ starship
