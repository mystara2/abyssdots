# Themeing

* QSS template for wal
* Prism Launcher template for wal/and or Kvantum.
* Figure out how to get Zen Browser to work w/ pywal, *(saw a thing abt it, not sure how to get it to work.)*

# Scripts

* Make editconfig have a keybinds key at the bottom
* Make install deps look nicer && have a normal install.sh for just everything including either stow or sm else.
